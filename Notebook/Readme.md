# Machine Learning Model Comparison
In this analysis, seven machine learning models were utilized to predict the sourcing cost. The models included:

1. AdaBoost

2. Decision Tree
 
3. Extra Tree Regression
4. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
5. Linear Regression
6. Random Forest
7. XGBoost

# Evaluation Metrics
The evaluation of model performance was based on the following metrics:

**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Represents the average magnitude of errors in the predictions.

**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors, providing a more comprehensive view of prediction accuracy.

**R2 Score**: Also known as the coefficient of determination, R2 Score indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of seven machine learning models for predicting sourcing cost revealed varying degrees of performance across different algorithms. Random Forest emerged as the top performer, exhibiting the lowest error metrics and highest R2 Score, followed closely by the Decision Tree model. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) also demonstrated competitive predictive accuracy, ranking third among the models considered. However, Linear Regression showed less favorable performance compared to the other models, indicating limitations in its predictive capability for this task.

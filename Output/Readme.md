### Results
The analysis of seven machine learning models for predicting sourcing costs showcased diverse performances across different algorithms. Among them, Random Forest emerged as the standout performer, boasting the lowest error metrics and the highest R2 Score. Following closely behind, the Decision Tree model displayed competitive performance, reinforcing its effectiveness in predictive tasks. Additionally, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) showcased commendable predictive accuracy, securing the third position among the models evaluated. Conversely, Linear Regression exhibited suboptimal performance compared to its counterparts, highlighting its limitations in accurately predicting sourcing costs. These findings underscore the significance of selecting appropriate machine learning algorithms tailored to the unique characteristics and demands of the predictive task at hand.
